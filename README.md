S1 Archipelago patch
====================

This is based on s1disasm_git, changes in this branch are my work but only that.  For the purpose of the Archipelago experience, the following changes have been made:

- Sonic doesn't lose lives when dying.
- SRAM has been enabled to persist AP data between runs.
- Press C on a pause screen to immediately exit whatever level you're in.
